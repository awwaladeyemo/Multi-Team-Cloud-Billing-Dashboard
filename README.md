# 🌐 FinOps Project: Mock AWS Billing Dashboard (June 2025)

This project simulates real-world FinOps analysis using a mock AWS billing dataset across multiple teams and cloud services. It demonstrates cost allocation, usage trends, optimization strategies, and cross-team accountability — all core to the FinOps discipline.

---

## 📁 Project Contents

- `mock-billing-dataset.xlsx` – Raw dataset of daily cloud usage
- `analysis.md` – Insights and recommendations
- `/screenshots/` – Visual dashboards (pie & stacked column charts)
- `README.md` – Project overview (this file)

## 🧾 Scenario Overview

You’re acting as a Cloud Financial Analyst for an organization with three teams:

- 🧠 **Data Team** – Uses EC2 and Athena for analytics
- 🌐 **App Team** – Runs APIs via Lambda & stores data in S3
- 🔧 **DevOps Team** – Manages infrastructure via CloudWatch, S3 Glacier, and CloudFormation

The goal: **analyze usage patterns, allocate spend accurately, and recommend cost optimizations** based on simulated data.

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- **Data Team dominated costs (~55%)**, largely due to EC2 and Athena usage  
- **DevOps services (CloudWatch, Glacier)** had steady background costs worth monitoring  
- **Shared services like CloudWatch** need clear tagging or cost allocation practices  
- **Recommendation highlights**:
  - Use scheduled start/stop on EC2
  - Enforce tagging policies
  - Budget alerts on high-impact services

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Cloud cost attribution and FinOps analysis  
- Pivot table and charting skills (Google Sheets/Excel)  
- Data storytelling through visual dashboards  
- Recommendations aligned with FinOps principles

---

## 📎 Next Steps

- Expand dataset with multi-account or multi-region examples  
- Simulate tagging anomalies or unused resources  
- Practice CUR-style cost aggregation  
- Build a live dashboard in Power BI or QuickSight
